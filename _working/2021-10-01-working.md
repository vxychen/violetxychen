**Keywords: elicit fairness judgement from people, preference learning**

We study the elicitation of people’s fairness preferences in sequential policy design. When a planner designs long-term policies which can shift the social contexts, understanding the dynamics in social contexts, people's moral beliefs and policy-making states is useful for designing effective interventions. We propose formulating a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model to represent a sequential decision-making task. States in the MDP model describe social contexts by features, and people associate different rewards over state features based on their fairness preferences. To learn people's fairness judgement, we utilize the MDP model as the basis of an active preference-based reward learning framework. The learning process involves asking participants to compare trajectories of different policy interventions and the resulting social changes. We are planning user study experiments with the learning framework to understand people’s moral reasoning in a hypothetical scenario of allocating scarce medical resources. From these experiments, we aim to provide empirical insights about several key questions, including how fairness preferences evolve with social contexts, and whether incorporating the dynamic perspective on fairness benefits policymaking.
