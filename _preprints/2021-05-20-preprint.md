Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a popular class of machine learning methods whose training via specialized algorithms tends to outperform general-purpose optimization solvers. Motivated by this advantage, we propose specialized algorithms
4 to train SVMs with fairness guarantees, which is an important task in the growing
5 field of fair machine learning. We focus on SVM formulations that contain a set of
6 convex fairness constraint(s). Utilizing the structure of the dual formulation of this
7 particular form of fair SVM, we design a coordinate-descent based subroutine to
8 extend three leading dual-based standard SVM training algorithms to fair SVM.
9 These algorithms respectively inherit the theoretical guarantees of their standard
10 counterparts. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that these specialized algo11
rithms allow fairness to become a routine of SVM training without increasing the
12 runtime and computational cost relative to training standard SVMs.
