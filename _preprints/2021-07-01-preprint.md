We provide a survey of various schemes that have been proposed for formulating the ethics-related criteria of fairness and equity, including those that integrate efficiency and equity concerns. For the sampled schemes, we present what appears to be the best practical approach to formulating each criterion in a linear, nonlinear, or mixed integer programming model.
