I am an Assistant Professor in Analytics and Information Systems at [Stevens School of Business](https://www.stevens.edu/school-of-business). Before joining Stevens, I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Operations Research at [Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper), where I was fortunate to be advised by Professor [John Hooker](http://public.tepper.cmu.edu/jnh). In addition, I obtained my B.S. degrees in Applied Mathematics and Business Administration from [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu). 

My research interests are broadly related to fairness and ethics in AI-supported decision making. Some topics I am actively working on are: modeling fairness and equity in optimization, learning and inferring ethical preferences from people, social welfare perspectives of fairness in machine learning.

<!--Motivated by two fundamental questions, *what is fair* and *how to be fair*, I study a variety of fairness approaches and perspectives from optimization, machine learning, welfare economics and ethics. My projects aim to contribute insights about eliciting, formulating and operationalizing fairness and equity. -->

<!--My research interests are broadly related to fairness in various decision making frameworks and application domains. I study and utilize optimization as the main methodology. Motivated by two fundamental questions, what is fair and how to be fair, my projects seek to explore the use of optimization methods for formulating, attaining and understanding fairness. 
If you are interested in my research and related topics, I am happy to discuss further, please feel free to reach out via email or Linkedin. -->
