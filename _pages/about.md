I am a 5th year PhD Candidate in Operations Research at [Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper). I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [John Hooker](http://public.tepper.cmu.edu/jnh), and work with Professors [Fatma Kilinc-Karzan] and [Hoda Heidari]. Before joining CMU, I obtained my B.S. degrees in Applied Mathematics and Business Administration from [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu). 

My research interests are broadly related to fairness in various decision making frameworks and application domains. I study and utilize optimization as the main methodology. Motivated by two fundamental questions, what is fair and how to be fair, my projects seek to explore the use of optimization methods for formulating, attaining and understanding fairness. If you are interested in my research and related topics, I am happy to discuss further, please feel free to reach out via email or Linkedin.

I am actively involved with the [CMU INFORMS Student Chapter](https://cmuinforms.org). Outside graduate school, since January 2020, I am better known as Model's mom ([@modeldoodle](https://www.instagram.com/modeldoodle/?hl=en)). 

#### I am on the 2021-2022 academic job market. I will present at the 2021 INFORMS annual meeting: 
#### Session VMD76. Artificial Intelligence IV. 2:45PM-4:15PM (PDT), October 25, 2021.
