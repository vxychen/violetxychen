I am a 5th year PhD Candidate in Operations Research at [Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper). I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [John Hooker](http://public.tepper.cmu.edu/jnh), and work with Professors [Fatma Kılınç-Karzan](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/fkilinc) and [Hoda Heidari](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hheidari). Before joining CMU, I obtained my B.S. degrees in Applied Mathematics and Business Administration from [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu). 

My research interests are broadly related to **fairness in optimization and artificial intelligence**. Motivated by two fundamental questions, *what is fair* and *how to be fair*, I study a variety of fairness approaches and perspectives from optimization, machine learning, welfare economics and ethics. My projects aim to contribute insights about eliciting, formulating and operationalizing fairness and equity. 

I am actively involved with the [CMU INFORMS Student Chapter](https://cmuinforms.org). Outside graduate school, since January 2020, I am better known as the human for Model ([@modeldoodle](https://www.instagram.com/modeldoodle/?hl=en)).

<!--My research interests are broadly related to fairness in various decision making frameworks and application domains. I study and utilize optimization as the main methodology. Motivated by two fundamental questions, what is fair and how to be fair, my projects seek to explore the use of optimization methods for formulating, attaining and understanding fairness. 
If you are interested in my research and related topics, I am happy to discuss further, please feel free to reach out via email or Linkedin. -->
